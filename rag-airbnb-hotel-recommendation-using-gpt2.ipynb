These area are the heart and vibe of Seattle.  Capitol Hill is a neighborhood that doesn't fit easy stereotypes. Part hip and urban, part wooded and stately, it is a community that often feels like a small town in itself, one that a huge variety of business — and people from all walks of life — call home. Perhaps it's the diversity of our culture as well? maybe we're just lucky enough here where there aren´t many other cities around us who have such diverse cultures but still feel isolated because so few others do (or don`T) live close to them ? I think most Americans would agree about how much better off America was without Washington DC being at war over its borders .

park. mere blocks from key arena & space needle. short ride to pike place, stadiums, & convention center. enjoy the quiet, or a quick walk to tons of bars, restaurants, & shops! **please make sure to read all info before booking!** if you need info on anything not mentioned in the listing, just ask! pricing varies daily based on demand, but the calendar is always up to date. simply enter your travel dates into the calendar to check pricing and availability. the guest room is fairly large, very private, and has lots of personality! it's approx 250 sq ft, completely separate from the rest of the apartment, and includes a full size bed, kitchenette, vanity area with sink, and two closets that are exclusively for your use - my guests enjoy complete privacy! you'll have pretty much everything you need: hangers, shelves, organizers, extra sheets/towels, first aid kit, umbrella, hairdryer, and iron/ironing board. th\nLocation: Lower Queen Anne is amazing - you can walk to everything! This apartment is located in a quiet residential area, about 5-6 blocks from the neighborhood's main commercial area. Seattle Center (the plaza containing the Space Needle, EMP, Pacific Science Center, Key Arena, etc.) is about a 15 minute walk.
